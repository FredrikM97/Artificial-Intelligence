Task 2) 
The code does not go into deadlock (due to the timer, remove the timer will create a deadlock), this is because circular wait does not occur, this could be an unique situation on my computer where this does not happend. 

Task 3)
A solution would be to let the last phils pick up the inverse of previous phils forks. Instead of starting with left to right, it takes right to left. Not sure if this is needed since the program doesnt crash after 600 "eat" on the different phils with the check of a counter as debug tool.

Task 4)
It works pretty well, in order to stop the program a Thread.sleep is used that stops all threads in order to check the counter values.

Task 5)
