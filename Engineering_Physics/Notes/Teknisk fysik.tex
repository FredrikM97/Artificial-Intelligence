\subsection{Newtons laws}
Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it.
Force equals mass times acceleration f(t)=ma(t)
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

\subsection{Electric charge and electric Field}
Electric force on uncharged objects \newline
Negatively charged plastic comb causes a slight shifting of charge within the molecules of the neutral insulator, an effect called
polarization.
