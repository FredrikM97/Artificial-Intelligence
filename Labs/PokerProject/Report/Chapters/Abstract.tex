\section*{Abstract}
Games without exact solutions are common ways to learn machine learning. For that purpose we'll be making a crude machine learning based agent for five card poker. We'll start by explaining how this implementation is done and then give it the PEAS description of which the feature vector is based upon. Prior to the intended tournament a problem with the server was observed. This problem lead to most groups, with us included, withdrawing from the tournament. The server issue shut down any hope of testing the model in the environment it was built for. Post tournament this was fixed and revealed that the model had only learned a bias.
