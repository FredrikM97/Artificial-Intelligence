Task 1 “E”: Implement k-NN regression
• Modify your K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm in task 1A to find a model to fit the
“FuelConsumption” data in Lab4Data.csv. For this task you are not allowed to use the kNN function in scikit-learn library (you need to implement this regression model by
your own using python).
In your report, you need to explain the algorithm and write the evaluation results of the
regression model in your report.
