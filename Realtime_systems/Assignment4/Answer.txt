Task 2) 
The code does not go into deadlock, this is because circular wait does not occur (due to the timer, remove the timer will create a deadlock). 

Task 3)
A solution would be to let the last phils pick up the inverse of previous phils forks. Instead of starting with left to right, it takes right to left. 

Task 4)
It works pretty well, in order to stop the program a Thread.sleep is used that request a interrupt for  all threads in order to check the counter values.

Task 5)
DONE
